### Data Transformation and Integration using PDI 

ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load is a set of processes for getting data from different data sources, transforming it into a format that is required, and then loading the data into a destination data storage.

Steps in ETL are classified into 3 parts:
-   Extacts which is composed of all the processing that is required to connect to various data sources and then extract data from these sources.
-   Transform includes any function applied to the extracted data eg cleanning and validating the data against the business rule, modifying the data or the structure of the data,i.e if you want to rename some columns, change the type of columns and so on. 
-   Load include all of the process of loading the data into a target system. This part includes several processors like surrogate management, table management and several other processors.

You can load the data into a data warehouse or a data mart.
