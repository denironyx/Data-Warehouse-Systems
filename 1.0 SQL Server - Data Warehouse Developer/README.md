# Data-Warehouse-Systems
In this repository, I sahre an End to End BI & DW project done to improve my understanding of Data warehouse processes.

The dataset is created by Microsoft a long time ago the fictitious multinational manufacturing company called adventure works and shipped the AdventureWorks database as part of SQL Server. The dataset still exist does exist, with nearly 20,000 customers, over 70,000 orders and 500 products there is a enough data for examples. 

You can download a backup of the database for your version of SQL Server as part of the SQL Server Samples Repository. You can choose between these editions:

- OLTP data is for most typical online transaction processing workloads
- Data Warehouse (DW) data is for data warehousing workloads
- Lightweight (LT) data is a lightweight and pared down version of the OLTP sample.
